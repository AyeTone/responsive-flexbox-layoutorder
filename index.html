                <p>I am a front end developer in training. Right now I am currently unemployed and 
                working hard to get trained so that I can purse a career in the tech field!

                <p>I was born in D.C but was raised in Maryland. I am full-bloodied Jamacian
                but unlike my parents I don't have the thick accent. I moved around a lot when I was 
                younger so I am really good at adapting to my surroundings.

            <div id="div-2" class="flex-items">
                <p>My passion: I am gamer and love to vibe out to music. Although I don't play as many games
                that I have in the pass or make as much music, I still do so whenever I have some free time.

            <div id="div-3" class="flex-items">
                <p>Fun fact: A few years ago, when I was still pursing music as a career, I had the honor
                to meet 21 Savage and Brandy whilst working as an intern at music studio. It was cool
                experience that made me remember that although they are famous, they are still human
                just like me and you. </p>
